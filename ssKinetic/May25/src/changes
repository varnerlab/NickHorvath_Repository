change TX kinetics to be sat in GENE and first-order in RNAP
change stoichiometry matrix to no longer include GENE, RNAP, OPEN_GENE

change rate[180] to 0		TX init no longer occurs
change rate[181] to 5400	TX kcat instead of Vmax
	was .6740711787216361 previously

change rate[183] to 0		TL init no longer occurs
change rate[184] to 240
	was 40.106026792106334 prevously


change rate[386] to 0		mRNA deg has no enzyme

change rate[385], [388] to 0
