Outreach:

    departmental outreach activities (CBE Women, Grasshopper, etc.)

    EYH simulation project next year

Academic/Professional:

    Publishing the E. coli cell-free paper is the top priority

    Model a more detailed description of transcription and translation
        Next paper: fully kinetic model against hybrid cybernetic model

    Build a fully kinetic glycoprotein model
        The DeLisa lab has cell-free glycoprotein data

    Already went to a conference this year, will go to one next year
	    possibly AIChE, abstract is due in April

    Do the A exam in the early summer
        June (have ssKinetic paper mostly done)

    Set committee this semester
	    Drs. Varner and DeLisa + one more
            possibly Fengqi You

        DeLisa: bio questions during A exam
        Fengqi You: hard math & optimization questions during A exam
            look at mega-poster to get an idea

    Possible NSF GROW PIs:
        Uwe Sauer               ETHZ
        Jens Nielsen            Chalmers, Sweden
        van Riel                Dutch place
